<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>M: Emma will you sing a song with me? <br>
The words are on this paper, it's a very simple melody<br>
<br>
E: Matthew won't you come and visit me?<br>
I know you're bad at dancing, but just one dance will mean everything<br>
<br>
M: Emma will you reminisce with me?<br>
Yah high school was the worst but I don't wanna forget anything<br>
<br>
E: Matthew tell me how I can be happy?<br>
I'm sick of all these stupid men, they always ruin everything<br>
<br>
M: Emma can you learn to stay on key?<br>
I am trying to be famous and you're hurting my chances b<br>
<br>
E: Matthew can you kill the ego please?<br>
We both know who the talent is, you can sing the harmonies<br>
<br>
B: Emma will you sing a song with me?<br>
Maybe if we're lucky we'll end up singing on TV<br>
Singing silly songs and making history<br>
E: I'll be Debbie Harry (M)and I'll be the rest of Blondie<br>
<br>
M: My turn! Emma, thanks for being friends with me<br>
Everything we've been through, it's been five years you've put up with me<br>
And I cherish our memories, so thanks I guess for saying no when I first asked you to go<br>
out with me<br>
<br>
M: Cause that would have been awful<br>
E: Yah, agreed<br></p>

<h2>Cute Song #1</h2>
<p>E: We drove to Santa Barbara for the weekend<br>
M: Except we didn't drive because you don't have a car<br>
E: You learned to love and I learned to love my weaknesses<br>
M: Yes, I learned to swim and you learned to trust your heart<br>
<br>
M: We drove to San Francisco for the summer<br>
E: We spent way too much time locked in our room<br>
M: You learned what love is and I learned that hummus is a game-changer<br>
E: Yes, I learned to grow and you learned yourself a heart<br>
<br>
B: We're not in love, we're much too smart<br>
We're much too young, our fragile hearts<br>
Are growing longer and stronger and older and bolder and wiser and more involved with each other<br>
But we ain't in love, not yet, we don't fall fast<br>
<br>
M: We ran away to Vegas to gamble it all away<br>
E: We lost the money, but we made it all back the next day<br>
M: You learned to fight and I learned to listen to you<br>
E: You pushed me hard, but darlin' I needed the push<br>
<br>
E: We moved to San Diego to start a family<br>
M: We moved to San Diego to settle down<br>
E: I found a house<br>
M: and I found a job<br>
E: And I called my mother<br>
M: and I called my pa<br>
B: And we built a great big life with each other<br>
We learned to live this life with each other<br>
We don't fall fast, but I'm just glad we fell at all</p>

<h2>Wash</h2>
<p>Into the street with sand on our feet<br>
I can't stand the sunshine on concrete<br>
You tell me it's simple philosophy<br>
Finding beauty in the little things<br>
<br>
"Come back to sleep and I'll dream you downstream"<br>
And your morning voice sings to me gently like fallen trees<br>
I'm following you like you're falling for me<br>
I stay quiet for you, but I never fall back asleep<br>
<br>
I really only ever want this with you<br>
I really really only want this for you<br>
(I couldn't ever be there for you)<br>
<br>
I gaze towards the moon and she gazes towards me<br>
Through the telephone static, she's whispering<br>
Choreography and the ocean is listening<br>
And I realized that maybe she's moving me too<br>
<br>
I let it wash over me, under me<br>
I let you watch over me, under me</p>

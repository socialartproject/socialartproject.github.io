<h2>John</h2>
<h2>Emma</h2>
<p>You don’t have to try so hard, there’s a liar in your laughter and it gives you away sometimes<br>
<br>
You don’t have to choose<br>
Between what I want for you<br>
Just know I’ll keep it open on the weekends for you<br>
If you need me to, like I need you<br>
<br>
We sat underneath the stars and felt afraid<br>
I think that was the first time I said His name<br>
On that football field, we looked up and saw just how much things change<br>
Do you remember?<br>
<br>
But I don’t know you anymore<br>
I used to sing this song<br>
For Emma, Emma, Emma<br>
<br>
You don’t have to be so brave<br>
Someday you’ll find the choices had been made for you<br>
Perfectly made for you, I prayed for you<br>
<br>
And I would have kept a million little secrets for you<br>
A hundred million women marched over the deep end for you<br>
Now who’s gonna keep you safe?<br>
<br>
But you don’t owe me anymore<br>
I hope you’ll sing this one<br>
For Emma<br>
<br>
We used to drive, around at night, now I keep my window open just in case you find the light<br>
Sometimes I hear, your voice at night, I’ll just keep drawing horses until I see your smile<br>
We built a memory inside those drives, and I dream you into closeness when I’ve got nowhere to hide<br>
I tried, and we both tried, but I’d still keep you my promise if we finally say goodbye</p>
<h2>Beth</h2>
<h2>Sierra</h2>
<p>We used to share fears between us<br>
We’d sit and talk in your mom’s mini-van<br>
We used to care about something<br>
Do you remember what?<br>
<br>
I’ve been so afraid to call you<br>
Paralyzed hoping that you would call me<br>
Tell me that everything’s better,<br>
Tell me that you were afraid to call me<br>
And I’d be absolved<br>
<br>
I hope if I have a daughter<br>
She is as strong and as caring as you<br>
You don’t need anyone’s permission<br>
You’re a good woman and a good friend<br>
<br>
You can talk me down<br>
You can change my mind<br>
And you had to some of the time<br>
<br>
We walked for hours by the ocean<br>
I was just glad I could still make you laugh<br>
I hope I’ll be there at your wedding<br>
He sounds like a good man<br>
<br>
Goodbye sounds like an apology<br>
I just hope mine sounds sincere<br>
After all, I’m not coming back here<br>
<br>
It’s all caving in<br>
Would you hold my hand?<br>
Like you did when we both felt scared<br>
<br>
I’m on the cusp of remission<br>
I was about to go back on my word<br>
But you are a book I’m still reading<br>
I lost my page, but I’m not giving up<br>
And I might not see you, but I wish you luck

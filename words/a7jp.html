<h2>Matthew</h2>
<p>It is not good to be alone<br>
I saw you yesterday, you were on the telephone<br>
You said your aunt had passed away<br>
And you fell in your mothers arms when you went home<br>
<br>
It's this picture I have seen<br>
We're on a sloping hill of green<br>
And you are walking there beside me<br>
Don’t forget what you’ve forgotten<br>
<br>
You cannot do this on your own<br>
Feels like yesterday, you were singing all alone<br>
I wrote a song for you today<br>
It sounds...<br>
<br>
There’s something bigger than this life<br>
I thought I’d captured it on a tape one time<br>
But it was just your voice singing with mine<br>
And we dubbed over it to record a second time<br>
<br>
And in trying to live an honest life<br>
I find a lie almost every time<br>
But I can build a prayer into a life<br>
And now yours is saved and so is mine<br>
<br>
You picked up my guitar and tried to sing<br>
Your fingers trembling on the strings<br>
Why don’t you do the damn thing?<br>
<br>
There is no shame in letting go<br>
I used to be afraid, now I’m both<br>
I’m only naked when I wear your clothes<br>
<br>
I just wanna be a good person, trynna live my life for you</p>
<h2>Alena</h2>
<p>i will carry you over my shoulder<br>
don’t let no one define you<br>
when you bury your face in your arms<br>
do you dream about leaving your life behind?<br>
<br>
how’s your family? how’s gabby, how’s mika?<br>
and migs, are they listening with you?<br>
i might never see your house again<br>
it feels strange just to say it out loud<br>
<br>
i will carry you into your room<br>
i have known you since you were a child<br>
even though we had no way of knowing<br>
how much we’d share one life<br>
<br>
i will carry you into the river<br>
we will sing three-part harmony<br>
if you sing with me, but no one hears us<br>
we’ll both have one memory<br>
<br>
i’m afraid of my own disposition<br>
you just want life to begin again<br>
but we both know that life only begins when you know how to suffer it<br>
<br>
i will learn how to speak in your language<br>
we can tell jokes in secret<br>
i’d’ve written a song for you maybe<br>
if only we’d had more time<br>
<br>
i will carry you under my weakness<br>
will you keep me from dying?<br>
i will care for you, bowed in defeat<br>
if you’re with me, my sister in Christ</p>
<h2>Duriel</h2>
<p>You took a picture of my body<br>
You flashed a light, now I can’t see<br>
Sometimes I wake up in a panic<br>
Sometimes I don’t know how to breathe<br>
<br>
I had a dream you stole my body<br>
You stood outside of everything<br>
Potential wilderness surrounds you<br>
You’ll live forever in that dream<br>
<br>
You are the Queen of San Francisco<br>
You are the King of everything<br>
You’re always on the verge of laughing<br>
At something I can’t even see<br>
<br>
And I’m made of gold<br>
I never know when you’re lying<br>
<br>
When you let me go out in your jacket<br>
Somehow I felt like I was free<br>
Nobody saw us, we just went walking<br>
Wearing your clothes, I felt like me<br>
<br>
I can’t stop thinking about your sadness<br>
I want to hide it in a cave<br>
But you’re so adventurous, you’d go find it<br>
I know that I can’t keep you safe<br>
<br>
When you went missing, I didn’t call you<br>
Can you forgive me?<br>
Your camera showed me how to care for<br>
All the things it lets us see</p>
<h2>Keri</h2>
<p>Everything is beautiful<br>
But you don’t like to speak in absolutes<br>
But if you needed proof, just look around you<br>
There’s a silent garden growing in your bedroom<br>
<br>
Everything is terrifying<br>
I’m afraid of things that can’t be true<br>
But where does that leave you? I hold you tight, but there’s a man standing outside waiting to hurt you<br>
<br>
Everything is difficult<br>
We argue when there’s nothing else to do<br>
That’s why we never really argue—if you cook for me tonight, tomorrow night I’ll cook for you<br>
<br>
Everything’s expensive now<br>
I mean how much could a house cost if it’s used?<br>
So what can two kids lose?<br>
Would you go 50/50 with me on a stock or two?<br>
<br>
Everything is empathy<br>
I once heard someone sing, “building a ladder of love to you<br>
And I hope you build one too”<br>
And I’ll meet you on the roof<br>
<br>
Everything is desideria<br>
The blue of distance folds me into you<br>
But it blindfolds me too<br>
Cause when you can’t see me, it’s not because I’m far away, it’s cause I’m too close to you<br>
<br>
Everything is effortless<br>
I wrote this song and barely even moved<br>
But that’s just what I do for you<br>
And you listen with such patience, I’m inclined to listen too<br>
<br>
Everything’s didactic<br>
If you ask me, probably this song is too<br>
Why don’t you tell me something new?<br>
There is a lesson in the question in the answer to the truth<br>
<br>
Everything is binary<br>
It’s either or it’s neither, you can choose<br>
And I’m scared of what you’ll do<br>
Cause I told the truth and you have my secrets now or do my secrets have you?<br>
<br>
Everything is arbitrary<br>
Promises and obligations too<br>
There is only me and you—and you inside of me inside this life and me inside of you<br>
<br>
Everything is everything<br>
I’d wasted my whole life away till I met you<br>
Now nothing’s nothing too, and something tells me that you’ll tell me something’s coming someday soon<br>
<br>
Everything is hopeless<br>
So do the only sacred thing and tell the truth<br>
And I’ll hold onto you; cause when I’m walking in the night, I feel His holy warming light, I’ve got my elevator pitch, I’ve got my sense of wrong and right; I hold you tight but there’s something in it for me, what’s in it for you?<br>
<br>
I want to never hurt you<br>

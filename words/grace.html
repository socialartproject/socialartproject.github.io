<h2>Immaterial Monument</h2>
<p>I walked through jacaranda trees<br>
The sunlight “streaming” through the leaves<br>
And I missed my mother’s cooking<br>
How she used too much seasoning<br>
<br>
There’s magic in this perfect place<br>
And it’s flowing through our veins<br>
It only grows more lovely in this state of constant change<br>
<br>
Living at the end of history<br>
These relics that we bring with us are hidden in a screen<br>
And what a privilege to be seen<br>
<br>
So who the hell am I to complain?<br>
God knows my name and I see familiar faces every time I pray<br>
I think I’ll have a picnic today<br>
<br>
Memories of you in gold and green<br>
There is a chasm in between<br>
Am I holding on too tightly<br>
To something you had never seen?<br>
<br>
I walked through Westwood alleyways<br>
And all throughout my solemn day <br>
I press forward knowing that nothing stays the same<br>
<br>
Living in my parent’s distant dreams<br>
Is time an ocean or a stream?<br>
Spending the present sorting through the past and living somewhere in between<br>
<br>
Drifting along as the days fade<br>
Wondering if people ever stay<br>
The sunset a canvas of ochre paint<br>
Learning that life’s more give than take<br>
<br>
Conscious of the gentleness of things<br>
I step with care, I softly sing<br>
The rooftops stretch into the bluest sky I swear I’ve ever seen<br>
<br>
And what a gorgeous day awaits<br>
I see His love, I feel His grace<br>
All patient waiting is replaced with joyous, humble-minded praise<br>
<br>
There is no fear left to decide<br>
You cannot run, forget or hide<br>
Have you decided to forgive?<br>
Have you decided to be kind?<br>
<br>
Have you forgotten what you learned?<br>
Will you remember every time?<br>
What will you do with all this life<br>
On the other side of this?</p>

<h2>Nobody's Daughter</h2>
<p>all this time<br>
writing a song about you<br>
<br>
i’m right on<br>
writing my way back to you<br>
<br>
and in every line<br>
i can only find pieces of you<br>
<br>
i hate this song<br>
cause it only reminds me of you<br>
<br>
i’ve been waiting<br>
for things to get better someday<br>
i’ve got to get back to be safe<br>
<br>
i’ve been changing<br>
mold me and fold me, i’m made out of clay<br>
all of this in disarray<br>
<br>
head above water<br>
i’m nobody’s daughter<br>
and i am not sinking</p>

<h2>Something Different</h2>
<p>I don't know what I want<br>
But I know what I need<br>
I need something different<br>
Now when every other town is better than this one<br>
It's a big decision to run away with you<br>
I hope it works out this time</p>

<h2>Afterword / Hank</h2>
<p>Through the haze, I feel as if I’m only half living<br>
If I could take a step one way which way would you ask<br>
And throughout endless forests of indecision<br>
I’m asking you, to take my hand and lead me down the right path<br>
<br>
So it goes, we are just boats beating against the current<br>
Letting it, push and pull not knowing where it ends<br>
All along, I was the one with feet inside your footsteps<br>
So you'll find me, trailing far behind where you left<br>
<br>
Oh but now, I feel as if I can see the morning<br>
It may mean that all the present had to come to pass<br>
With dreary eyes, I will keep on pressing towards a future<br>
Though my ship is sailing with its flag at half mast<br>
<br>
As we grow<br>
We find it’s people that make a home</p>

Love,<br>
Matthew & Grace

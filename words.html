<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I'm going to keep those closest to me alive through my writing<br>
That way we’ll never hurt again<br>
I’m going to keep those closest to me alive through my writing about it<br>
And we’ll never<br>
<br>
Die or hear about it<br>
We’ll give it one good old college try<br>
And even if I don’t make it through my fourth semester<br>
One day I will laugh about it all<br>
<br>
Cause I want Emma to live forever even if she can’t<br>
<br>
I’m going to write myself into truth if it’s so esoteric<br>
That only I will understand<br>
I’m going to write myself into youth, if it’s the last thing I do<br>
And I’ll never say goodbye<br>
<br>
Or be lonely again<br>
Even if I’m lonesome now<br>
And I’m going to build my own little world inside of all my music<br>
One day, that’s where I’ll spend all my time<br>
<br>
Cause I want Ana to live forever even if she don't<br>
<br>
One day, I will be impervious to criticism<br>
And I’ll never cry again<br>
One day, I will write the song that grants us all forgiveness<br>
And I’ll throw my guitar in the sea<br>
Just leave it to me<br>
I’ll write us all free<br>
Just listen to me<br>
Yes, please buy my CD<br>
Spend a moment with me<br>
<br>
Because ultimately, I want to live forever and God knows I'll die<br>
God knows I'll die<br>
God knows I'll die trying</p><br>
	
<h2>Dick Gilbert’s Dream</h2>
<p>I thought I saw you in the night arcade<br>
Wearing only a kimono<br>
You were playing a street fighter game<br>
<br>
And I asked you if you knew my name<br>
You shook your head no<br>
When I turned back, you had changed into a Nekomata<br>

I thought I saw you at the Pergamon<br>
I was searching for salvation<br>
You were waiting at the Ishtar Gate<br>

I told you one day I’d be the white Bob Dylan<br>
And I’ve never been so nervous<br>
Than when you forgot to laugh<br>
<br>
You can find it in Nardis<br>
You can find it in Godot<br>
You can find it in the Redwoods<br>
And you can find it at home<br>
Well, you could find it in the Bible<br>
You can find it in your mother too<br>
After all she is the one who birthed you<br>
<br>
I could have sworn you were the singer at a jazz bar up in London<br>
You had the whole club dancing when you played “New York I Love You”<br>
<br>
Dancing in public for the first time in a long time<br>
I filmed every single second<br>
But the footage was destroyed in post<br>
<br>
And then you were the DJ at a German Disco<br>
You had even Francis dancing when you played “MacArthur Park”<br>
<br>
I spent the weekend trying to find you on the poster<br>
They shut the show down early<br>
But I caught you just outside<br>
<br>
And we rediscovered music<br>
On the banks of the Spree<br>
And by five o’clock your time<br>
We had set each other free<br>
Well you could find it in a country far away from where you supposed to be<br>
Do you think you’ll ever come back and see me?<br>
<br>
I think I said to you, something pretentious like, “I found it all in London<br>
My revolt, freedom, and passion<br>
That were never really mine”<br>
<br>
You could tell I had some deep regrets about traveling alone, but I wouldn’t tell a soul<br>
<br>
And I never saw it coming<br>
No I never learned your name<br>
And I tumbled down the mountain<br>
But I’m happy just the same<br>
Well if you can’t find it inside you<br>
You could hide it in the lesser truth<br>
But what a terrible thing to do<br>
<br>
And you said, “You fucked it all up trying to go so far,<br>
You should come back to Los Angeles<br>
And we’ll fall in love with movie stars<br>
<br>
“And we’ll go dancing and wear fur coats and convert to Judaism, no<br>
We’ll never be alone again and<br>
You will find me in your dreams”<br>
<br>
Of course, reality was not so strange<br>
You watched a silent movie<br>
While I fell asleep on the train<br>
<br>
We walked to my house in the cold wet streets<br>
You lent me Dinner with Andre<br>
	And we talked about it over coffee</p><br>
<h2>Thomas</h2>
<p>Thomas, I remember when we met <br>
I was studying abroad <br>
I was shopping Fortnum and Mason <br>
When you bumped into me hard <br>
I dropped my camera, cracked the screen <br>
All your friends laughed and called you the Queen of England <br>
I knew we were meant to be then <br>
<br>
You moved to the states two summers later <br>
I remember cause you sent me letter after letter <br>
Chronicling your stay <br>
"My friend, each day is better than the last; <br>
There must be something in the water cause I've never felt as joyous or as anxious to see someone again." <br>
<br>
Thomas, let's go to the movies <br>
I'm praying you won't listen to me <br>
Cause I never say anything at all <br>
<br>
Oh lover, I can't forget that first night <br>
Drunk off our distance, listening to Rhye <br>
And every day after was heaven, how pleasant to be in love <br>
Oh, and as days go by, I sit back and look fondly on our memories <br>
A lifetime spent with you is surely better than living twice <br>
<br>
And I swear it's like destiny: I mean, the two number one biggest fans of Todd Rundgren in one room-- what are the odds of that happening? <br>
Love blooms in the time between the private glances, the timid shake in your step as we dance to Queen <br>
Has it kicked in yet? or is this mercury poisoning? <br>
My God, you're killing me! <br>
<br>
Thomas, won't you marry me?<br>
Take me away from everything <br>
It feels like we've been dying on our own <br>
<br>
Oh lover, it's been years since we met <br>
But how is it I'm still learning your secrets <br>
You've never seen Forrest Gump, but you quote it every Valentine's Day <br>
And I'm glad we stuck it out <br>
When times were tough I had my doubts <br>
But when you smile I swear the clock stops and the ocean takes a breath <br>
Oh, endlessly receding, but it never really ends <br>
<br>
Thomas, you're gonna bury me <br>
There's something about your voice when we're arguing <br>
Reminds me of my father in the kitchen with my mother <br>
And they did not know that I was watching <br>
But I saw him teach her not to bother him no more <br>
Thomas, I'm sorry, I'm sure you'd never get that way <br>
If you have something to say don't let me get in the way <br>
And I'm sure things will turn out okay <br>
	Yes, I'm sure things will turn out just peachy</p><br>
		
<h2>Julia</h2>
<p>Lonely road I been traveling<br>
I can see for miles from where I stand<br>
But when it gets down to the business of it all<br>
I go back to where I been<br>
<br>
It’s a hopeless road I been traveling<br>
Many men have told me so<br>
Though I do have many years to go<br>
I feel indifference setting in<br>
<br>
I’m not searching for religion<br>
I’m just tryna find some truth<br>
And I’m not burning up with questions<br>
I’m just burning up my youth<br>
So, please don’t try to persuade me<br>
There’s nothing you know that I don’t<br>
If you are aching for some meaning<br>
It’s time to let the boulder go<br>
<br>
Cold wind blows in from the ocean<br>
But you don’t have those where you live<br>
Something left footsteps in the sand, they trace a winding path back home<br>
Where we used to be kids<br>
<br>
I’ll abandon my convictions<br>
I will leave the past for dead<br>
I will bare my soul completely<br>
I won’t ever leave my bed<br>
So, please don’t try to persuade me<br>
There’s nothing you know that I don’t<br>
You don’t have to forgive me unless you know what I’ve done<br>
<br>
I’m not searching for redemption <br>
I’m just trying to find a home<br>
There’s an answer in the question<br>
There’s nothing I know that you won’t<br>
But this song is not about me<br>
I only sing it cause you won’t<br>
<br>
Julia, Julia<br>
Please don’t listen to your father<br>
Don’t listen to your son<br>
You have everything you need<br>
If you can find it, at the bottom of your lungs<br>
I will not try to persuade you<br>
But I will answer you just once<br>
Yes, someday you’ll be alone<br>
And mom and dad have passed below<br>
And you’ll have no place else to go<br>
If you need me, I’ll be here always<br>
	But I promise you can make it on your own</p><br>
<h2>Oliver, originally written by Sierra Skye</h2>
<p>Oliver, I just want all of your love<br>
To be a big fish in a small pond<br>
I’ll test your mettle, babe, or test your luck<br>
Give you the rest of my heart<br>
<br>
Loving you is never easy, but it’s not hard<br>
Oliver, all I want is your love<br>
<br>
Looking out on the morning rain, I used to feel uninspired<br>
Till your eyes caught mine in the month of May<br>
It came so easy<br>
You came so easy to me<br>
Ease into me<br>
<br>
Oliver, I want you to see me as I am<br>
Oliver, I am broken in your warm hands<br>
Bump into my back and we will fall into the mattress and get drunk in two seconds flat<br>
What’s the matter with that?<br>
<br>
Oliver, I want all your thoughts<br>
Deliver me from what I most want<br>
A life like caramel and apples and cinnamon and rum<br>
You make my heart go mmmm<br>
<br>
Oliver, I just want all of your time<br>
To be the cadence in your simplest rhyme<br>
I’ll never settle unless I find you inside my heart<br>
All of her inside my heart<br>
<br>
	Olie, I’m a prize and you’re a catch and we’re a perfect match; you make my heart go !!!</p><br>

<h2>Maya</h2>
<p>Momma, I think I've found the one<br>
No, you don't understand momma, she's as free as the sun <br>
And as delicate too, just as blue and exactly as warm and exactly as true <br>
Momma, I feel about her the same way dad felt about you <br>
<br>
Can I tell you about her? <br>
She's changing my mind <br>
I've found after so much time spent together I've become kind <br>
And she only grows kinder, she's my daily reminder God's love is alive and inspired <br>
And I find that my life's a garden of gracious desire <br>
<br>
Shuffle my fingers; I'm nervous as always <br>
She's happiness, smiles and dancing-- she makes me feel old <br>
You know, it hurts me to know of the two of us I am the one with no soul <br>
As perfect as she is, I'm barely a line in a poem <br>
<br>
She takes a deep breath and never lets go <br>
The sky swells with rain and her lips move but her words come slow <br>
And the rain turns to snow; I'm gasping for air and she's asking to go <br>
She says, "This is the only way I know to help you grow." <br>
<br>
Open my window, let the sun in, and pick up a book <br>
I can't move my hands the right way, I can't make myself look <br>
So, I run my fingers like raised dots would press themselves in and my whole world would change <br>
	My room fills with music and I learn to turn a new page</p><br>
	
	<h2>Arthur</h2>
<p>My old man’s a painter<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He’s got a sexton’s patience and he’s got a one room flat<br>
He wears a rainter’s paincoat; he holds the Treasury keys<br>
And every Saturday evening, he paints a masterpiece<br>
And someday, if I can, I’m gonna be an artist the same as my old man<br>
<br>
My old man’s a Maytag repairman<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He’s never lost his temper, he’s never called me Matt<br>
He owes the Lord a favor, he tends the family tree<br>
And every Saturday evening, he digs for Sunday’s key<br>
And someday, if I can, I’m gonna own a coin wash the same as my old man<br>
<br>
My old man’s a folk song<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He never changes tempo, he’s never sharp or flat<br>
He has a simple melody that never changes key<br>
And on one Sunday evening, he taught the song to me<br>
And someday, if I can, I’m gonna write a song so sweet that it brings Jerusalem<br>
<br>
My old man’s a fountain<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He swallows up the ocean, but he always brings it back<br>
He casts a frightening shadow, he’s shallow as a dream<br>
And on one Sunday morning, he taught the sun to breathe<br>
And someday, if I can, I’m gonna be a mother the same as my old man<br>
<br>
My old man’s a fighter<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He bores into the Bible, and falls unto the mat<br>
He is leaving, I am leaving, but they never got Ali<br>
And on one Saturday evening, he gave Sunday to me<br>
And someday, if I can I’m going to fight the King of Judah and lose like my old man<br>
<br>
My old man’s a prophet<br>
And I don’t care what you think<br>
He celebrates the meager, he turns the other cheek<br>
He’s built a love worth giving, he gives it unto thee<br>
And on one Friday evening, he sold us into grief<br>
And someday, count to three<br>
I’m going to the garden same as my old king<br>
	Where the beauteous tree of golden olives blooms in fairest green</p><br>
	
	<h2>Tera, the first song I ever wrote</h2>
<p>They sunk the submarine on April 15th<br>
They promised us they’d never lost a war<br>
They all swore they’d never forget the war<br>
But now they’re veterans and we’re all ears<br>
<br>
Sing a hymnal about redemption and throw your body off a cliff<br>
Because you’re a martyr now and your soul is more important than your body is<br>
Hold a wicked candle above your heart to blur the line between the black and white<br>
<br>
You’re sick of all the therapy, why are you upset?<br>
Alcohol and cigarettes: we have cures for depression<br>
And I thought you lost your fear of staying here, when you left here<br>
But instead you lost your fear of dying<br>
<br>
Well, I’m sorry to tell you<br>
There’s no time for grieving, the President’s been shot dead<br>
It’s his head; they said it couldn’t handle the stress of his moral dilemma<br>
He slept on the couch and it’s never been better<br>
You’re slowly forgetting the letter you wrote back home<br>
They were too slow<br>
<br>
There’s a safety belt for a reason<br>
You sneak out the window to go climbing in trees<br>
And the birds and the bees and the words you’ve lost meaning for<br>
And everyone’s so sore and I’m so sure<br>
Life is a closing door<br>
<br>
So, take a lesson from the tree that never grew<br>
There is nothing you can achieve that you want to<br>
So, I’ll forget about it and watch TV till I fall asleep<br>
Oh, let’s move to Boston and talk to no one<br>
Is there anything else cause I’m tired of thinking?<br>
<br>
They’ve perfected the distraction, I don’t wanna go outside anymore<br>
Life’s so boring<br>
They ever cared about us anyway<br>
Honor the dead and bury the living while they’re still breathing<br>
Oh, they’re nobodies (there are no bodies)<br>
And they can hear the bombs are falling, while the bombs are falling, and the bombs are falling<br>
But your family is calling to see how you’re doing<br>
	Life in the pursuit of peacetime</p><br>
		
<h2>Kyle</h2>
<p>Wish I remembered what brought us together<br>
After school, alienation, some kind of  commiserative transgression<br>
Or an obsession with some obscure TV show<br>
Proximity, affinity, sublime connection, et cetera, cetera<br>
<br>
Hey! There ain't never gonna be friends like this again!<br>
I got the best of 'em, the rest of you suckers can go home<br>
Hey! <br>
Ain't nothing gon' come between me and my friends<br>
<br>
Semper fi or something, do or die, voluntary alibi<br>
Like I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine, <br>
Hit me up sometime<br>
Yah that's (760) 859-6140, I'm not exclusive, I got love for everyone, anyone<br>
<br>
Hey! There ain't never gonna be friends like this again!<br>
I got the best of 'em, the rest of you suckers can go home<br>
Hey! <br>
Ain't nothing gon' come between me and my friends<br>

Don’t listen to a word you hear<br>
If I am in your ear, know that you’re listening to me now<br>
Not the other way around<br>
Don’t listen to a word I say<br>
I felt the same way you did someday<br>
I am just a phone call away<br>
<br>
Hey! There ain't never gonna be friends like this again!<br>
I got the best of 'em, the rest of you suckers can go home<br>
Hey! <br>
Ain't nothing gon' come between me and my friends<br>
<br>
Kyle, I am listening to you now<br>
So tell me all about the fear we’ve only talked around<br>
And maybe we can drown them out<br>
	Or show each other how</p><br>		
<h2>Matthew</h2>
<p>Someone saved my life today<br>
Across the street, a woman called out my name<br>
And I don’t know hers, but I think I’ll name her Matthew<br>
Her voice split the night two ways<br>
She said, “Cross the street now boy, don’t go down that way,”<br>
And sure enough in the shadow of a street lamp, there was a wild dog looking at me<br>
With those yellow eyes that they give to all the false believers<br>
<br>
Had a dream it was yesterday<br>
An angel of the lord went to you and said<br>
It’s my time to take your time away<br>
Woke up and left the past for dead<br>
And an angel of your own came to me instead<br>
and told me, leave your dying landlord, she’s got nowhere to be<br>
I’ll take you to the city of our queen<br>
Where the streets are gold and the oil flows like Dick Cheney’s wettest dream<br>
<br>
I was born on the mourning day<br>
With golden yellow skin and blue eyes of gray<br>
They said, we’re cursed, but he won’t be, let’s name him Matthew<br>
Now, I know that God knows my name<br>
And I walk hand in hand with fate and I feel no pain<br>
Cause I shook hands with the devil and he smiled at me<br>
He said one day you’re going to be a king<br>
And you’ll write a million songs as retribution for the million lives you stole<br>
Yes, you’ll never be the king of anything unless you write yourself a soul<br>
<br>
Someone changed my life today<br>
I got a letter telling me it would be okay<br>
Because it’s more than what you seek<br>
She said it’s yours to take<br>
Woke up to a dream today<br>
She was standing right in front of my with another face<br>
I told her, you should know, I haven’t slept in weeks<br>
And she said, you’ll never write another Love Supreme<br>
And I told her, I’ll never write another song until I’m facedown in a grave<br>
Cause I only need to write one song and I think I wrote that song today <br>
<br>
And so if no one saves my life someday<br>
I need to learn now how to be okay<br>
There’s no good way to say it- I misplaced all my faith<br>
I must’ve sat down and prayed today<br>
Woody’s voice, must’ve been, came to me to say<br>
There’s no cathartic moment, you just have to ask for grace and now I know<br>
We’re walking with numbered days and<br>
How precious each step became<br>
Stuck a knife into his forehead, now he’s blinder than me<br>
And I said, Bob you won’t believe what I can see<br>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>M: Emma will you sing a song with me? <br>
The words are on this paper, it's a very simple melody<br>
<br>
E: Matthew won't you come and visit me?<br>
I know you're bad at dancing, but just one dance will mean everything<br>
<br>

<br>
M: Emma can you learn to stay on key?<br>

<br>
E: Matthew can you kill the ego please?<br>

<br>
M: My turn! Emma, thanks for being friends with me<br>

And I cherish our memories, so thanks I guess for saying no when I first asked you to go<br>
out with me<br>
<br>
M: Cause that would have been awful<br>

<h2>Cute Song #1</h2>
<p>E: We drove to Santa Barbara for the weekend<br>

<br>
B: We're not in love, we're much too smart<br>
We're much too young, our fragile hearts<br>
Are growing longer and stronger and older and bolder and wiser and more involved with each other<br>
But we ain't in love, not yet, we don't fall fast<br>
<br>
M: We ran away to Vegas to gamble it all away<br>
E: We lost the money, but we made it all back the next day<br>
M: You learned to fight and I learned to listen to you<br>
E: You pushed me hard, but darlin' I needed the push<br>
<br>

E: I found a house<br>
M: and I found a job<br>
E: And I called my mother<br>

We don't fall fast, but I'm just glad we fell at all</p>

<h2>Wash</h2>
<p>Into the street with sand on our feet<br>
I can't stand the sunshine on concrete<br>
You tell me it's simple philosophy<br>
Finding beauty in the little things<br>
<br>
"Come back to sleep and I'll dream you downstream"<br>
And your morning voice sings to me gently like fallen trees<br>
I'm following you like you're falling for me<br>
I stay quiet for you, but I never fall back asleep<br>
<br>
I really only ever want this with you<br>
I really really only want this for you<br>
(I couldn't ever be there for you)<br>
<br>
I gaze towards the moon and she gazes towards me<br>
Through the telephone static, she's whispering<br>
Choreography and the ocean is listening<br>
And I realized that maybe she's moving me too<br>
<br>
I let it wash over me, under me<br>
I let you watch over me, under me</p>

<h2>Dick Gilbert's 115th Dream</h2>
<p>I had a dream that I killed myself <br>
My father bought me cyanide pills <br>
Wrote a letter to my daughter in the future <br>
Walked into her room to have a conversation with her <br>
Don't remember anything I said <br>
It was insightful, I'm sure <br>
<br>
And I sat in a movie theater <br>
With two girls and a friend and we chose between women <br>
The whole thing was projected on a screen <br>
And I told her to dance but I was not impressed <br>
So we walked home through the rubble and snow <br>
Of this apocalyptic mess <br>
 <br>
And I drove on endless freeways <br>
And my family gave me conflicting directions, so I took the wrong one <br>
Yelled at my sister, yelled at my mother <br>
And my father handed money out the window <br>
Sealed my fate and sold for what <br>
And I was so grateful for his trust <br>
 <br>
And my son, he was not ready <br>
And the girl, she landed on me <br>
I sang so sweetly to her, she must have cried <br>
My stomach turned before I died <br>
I paced from room to room, but my friends were nowhere <br>
And Joey was on TV, but the house was empty and my daughter closed the door <br>
 <br>
Took them in a cabin somewhere <br>
They tasted much more sour than I imagined <br>
Walked from Ross' room to Chandler's and the TV told me swallow <br>
Called my dad and asked him why brother <br>
He just wanted to engage, so <br>
I walked into the patio light and woke up again and again and again</p>
<h2>A Letter to Carry</h2>
<p>Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
I am telling you goodbye <br>
I am moving to New England, with my mother, she's the perfect alibi <br>
Please don't search for me my darling, I did not leave any trace of me behind <br>
Please don't search for me, my darling, I am leaving you this simple lullaby <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
I am leaving to Peru <br>
I will walk among the mountains, like any decent mountaineer would do <br>
Please don't follow me my darling, I will be at a much higher altitude <br>
Your lungs will not adjust, so you must not follow me into the doom <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
From the hills of Antioch <br>
There are people all around me, but these people do not know that I am lost <br>
I am building a new life here, but the world's too far away for me to walk <br>
But if it wasn't for the cradle, I don't know that I'd be giving you this rock <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
I have found another girl <br>
She is teaching me to sing on key, she is showing me the world <br>
She is old, but she is kind, she is lumpy but she's mine, she's divine <br>
Please don't take it too hard darling, it's a lie, I just want somehow to be heard <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
The only draft that I will send <br>
I am placing faith in nature, I am sending you this letter by the wind <br>
I have found it difficult to swim across the big wide ocean, just a bit more difficult than finding words to give this motion <br>
So, this will not give it justice, but I love you and I hope you're doing well <br>
And if you do return, come quickly, cause I only have a few things left of yours to sell</p>

is size subjective? (does it matter?) <br>
who got your fucking hopes up? (do they?) <br>
 <br>
let me know because <br>
i always feel a little unreal after everything <br>
happens and you leave <br>
and barreling towards us but <br>
we can't get out of the way <br>
or don't want to <br>
or don't care <br>
 <br>
(care modifies everything) <br>
 <br>
try it <br>
plant a (insert) inside your palm <br>
or is it your heart? (insert modifies your) <br>
watch it (insert) or let it (insert) or (insert) or <br>
don't do anything at all <br>
don't move a muscle (muscle modifies fear) <br>
(also modifies memory) (fear modifies (insert)) <br>
((insert) modifies see it?) silent () <br>
 <br>
kill it <br>
there's this bright blue lover (blue modifies love) <br>
and it's hurtling (silent l)y past us (Past-Us) <br>
past tense (or is it pass up?) <br>
maybe it's just poor luck <br>
is neglection subjective? (can you see it?) <br>
before it kills you (before it kills you) <br>
and you kill me (you modifies me)</p>

<h2>El Cadejo</h2>

<p>i'm glad my subatomic particles decided to shake near yours <br>
because if they hadn't, they might be <br>
feeling a little more uneasy about all this <br>
 <br>
it may be that we rubbed off on each other and left a few pieces behind, <br>
the stragglers scrambling to get back home, <br>
and maybe that's why i can't get close enough <br>
it's deeper than skin <br>
 <br>
i think, but don't believe, but <br>
i think we were born to be alive at the same time and maybe nothing more <br>
 <br>
i am corrupting you <br>
kind of like how sunsets collapse skies until they're just silver pins of light <br>
tucked into a mirror <br>
and we connect them with something of our own <br>
maybe it's like touching god <br>
 <br>
i can reveal the future; watch <br>
but you have to wait awhile <br>
and then it will all happen <br>
 <br>
it's self-referential <br>
it's genuflection with your knees buckled in, <br>
it's dripping sweat, but it's wine, but instead of wine, it's blood, it's <br>
honeybees scratching behind your teeth <br>
and building hives in your cavernous body, <br>
cavernous <br>
only to them <br>
 <br>
you are more like a deer than a dog, and more dear to me than the things i cannot see <br>
like honeybees scratching inside your heart <br>
 <br>
i'm building a house <br>
or another metaphor for learning <br>
something i'm not quite comfortable with <br>
the physical manifestation of my desire to provide you with <br>
something i can't articulate <br>
but feels a lot like doom <br>
 <br>
but if it gets so bad, we can <br>
sit on my porch, watch Him rip holes in the fabric <br>
and plead <br>
leave it untouched, no one goes there <br>
no one wants to, we just watch <br>
 <br>
to me, it's a meadow, nestled beneath the golden hearth, tucked like a birds feathers, <br>
warm, supple, magnetic, <br>
it's miles long and i can cross with just one stride <br>
and my footsteps leave no prints <br>
 <br>
i believe that i love you <br>
i know the sun will rise, but i believe it will bring warmth <br>
 <br>
i think, but don't believe, but <br>
i think there is a god for nature and a god of humans <br>
and i think one of them is <br>
me and one of them is you </p>

<h2>Cobwebs</h2>

<p>As I clean out the last box from my room, I see a spider crawling through the threshold,<br>
moving in.<br>
He's renting the house from my family as they move across country and I move<br>
across mine.<br>
<br>
My family and I are going our separate ways,<br>
citing creative differences.<br>
I am John Lennon and they are the Beatles;<br>
I am the most successful for now,<br>
but I'll be dead soon and Paul will take my place.<br>
<br>
The new tenant brings his family in,<br>
swarms of a big, black pulsing crawling through cracks in the hardwood, through the windows, up from the sewer, into<br>
the kitchen, the bedroom, the photo albums, the sock drawers,<br>
the time I chased my sister into the banister, the broken dishwasher, all wriggling legs and little eyes, into the last time we eat dinner together, past the threshold, the empty space between my mother's heart and my father's grace.<br>
They weave<br>
a silken thread into the very fabric of life.<br>
<br>
A vision, as I drive down the five with my car packed, away from home, towards home<br>
of my car splintering open from the side, skidding across traffic-<br>
my mangled corpse, bloodied with road rash, scattered amongst the landmarks of a life once lived.<br>
Y'know, papers and such.<br>
<br>
I am the man tasked with building the biggest enclosure in the world,<br>
who constructs a small fence around himself and claims he's on the outside.<br>
I guess it's all a matter of perspective.<br>
<br>
I am exploring myself on the street, rummaging through the debris, looting the body.<br>
I am suffering as the spider eats the beetle with uncanny precision.<br>
I am building a fence and I am standing on the outside,<br>
watching spiders spin webs, catching everything I love,<br>
thinking I'm going to miss everything-<br>
No, I'm going to miss everything<br></p>

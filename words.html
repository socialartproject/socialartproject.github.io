<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>M: Emma will you sing a song with me? <br>
The words are on this paper, it's a very simple melody<br>
<br>
E: Matthew won't you come and visit me?<br>
I know you're bad at dancing, but just one dance will mean everything<br>
<br>
M: Emma will you reminisce with me?<br>
Yah high school was the worst but I don't wanna forget anything<br>
<br>
E: Matthew tell me how I can be happy?<br>
I'm sick of all these stupid men, they always ruin everything<br>
<br>
M: Emma can you learn to stay on key?<br>
I am trying to be famous and you're hurting my chances b<br>
<br>
E: Matthew can you kill the ego please?<br>
We both know who the talent is, you can sing the harmonies<br>
<br>
B: Emma will you sing a song with me?<br>
Maybe if we're lucky we'll end up singing on TV<br>
Singing silly songs and making history<br>
E: I'll be Debbie Harry (M)and I'll be the rest of Blondie<br>
<br>
M: My turn! Emma, thanks for being friends with me<br>
Everything we've been through, it's been five years you've put up with me<br>
And I cherish our memories, so thanks I guess for saying no when I first asked you to go<br>
out with me<br>
<br>
M: Cause that would have been awful<br>
E: Yah, agreed<br></p>

<h2>Cute Song #1</h2>
<p>E: We drove to Santa Barbara for the weekend<br>
M: Except we didn't drive because you don't have a car<br>
E: You learned to love and I learned to love my weaknesses<br>
M: Yes, I learned to swim and you learned to trust your heart<br>
<br>
M: We drove to San Francisco for the summer<br>
E: We spent way too much time locked in our room<br>
M: You learned what love is and I learned that hummus is a game-changer<br>
E: Yes, I learned to grow and you learned yourself a heart<br>
<br>
B: We're not in love, we're much too smart<br>
We're much too young, our fragile hearts<br>
Are growing longer and stronger and older and bolder and wiser and more involved with each other<br>
But we ain't in love, not yet, we don't fall fast<br>
<br>
M: We ran away to Vegas to gamble it all away<br>
E: We lost the money, but we made it all back the next day<br>
M: You learned to fight and I learned to listen to you<br>
E: You pushed me hard, but darlin' I needed the push<br>
<br>
E: We moved to San Diego to start a family<br>
M: We moved to San Diego to settle down<br>
E: I found a house<br>
M: and I found a job<br>
E: And I called my mother<br>
M: and I called my pa<br>
B: And we built a great big life with each other<br>
We learned to live this life with each other<br>
We don't fall fast, but I'm just glad we fell at all</p>

E: Me too!</p>

<h2>Wash</h2>
<p>Into the street with sand on our feet<br>
I can't stand the sunshine on concrete<br>
You tell me it's simple philosophy<br>
Finding beauty in the little things<br>
<br>
"Come back to sleep and I'll dream you downstream"<br>
And your morning voice sings to me gently like fallen trees<br>
I'm following you like you're falling for me<br>
I stay quiet for you, but I never fall back asleep<br>
<br>
I really only ever want this with you<br>
I really really only want this for you<br>
(I couldn't ever be there for you)<br>
<br>
I gaze towards the moon and she gazes towards me<br>
Through the telephone static, she's whispering<br>
Choreography and the ocean is listening<br>
And I realized that maybe she's moving me too<br>
<br>
I let it wash over me, under me<br>
I let you watch over me, under me</p>

<h2>Dick Gilbert's Dream</h2>
<p>I had a dream that I killed myself <br>
My father bought me cyanide pills <br>
Wrote a letter to my daughter in the future <br>
Walked into her room to have a conversation with her <br>
Don't remember anything I said <br>
It was insightful, I'm sure <br>
<br>
And I sat in a movie theater <br>
With two girls and a friend and we chose between women <br>
The whole thing was projected on a screen <br>
And I told her to dance but I was not impressed <br>
So we walked home through the rubble and snow <br>
Of this apocalyptic mess <br>
 <br>
And I drove on endless freeways <br>
And my family gave me conflicting directions, so I took the wrong one <br>
Yelled at my sister, yelled at my mother <br>
And my father handed money out the window <br>
Sealed my fate and sold for what <br>
And I was so grateful for his trust <br>
 <br>
And my son, he was not ready <br>
And the girl, she landed on me <br>
I sang so sweetly to her, she must have cried <br>
My stomach turned before I died <br>
I paced from room to room, but my friends were nowhere <br>
And Joey was on TV, but the house was empty and my daughter closed the door <br>
 <br>
Took them in a cabin somewhere <br>
They tasted much more sour than I imagined <br>
Walked from Ross' room to Chandler's and the TV told me swallow <br>
Called my dad and asked him why brother <br>
He just wanted to engage, so <br>
I walked into the patio light and woke up again and again and again</p>
<h2>A Letter to Carry</h2>
<p>Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
I am telling you goodbye <br>
I am moving to New England, with my mother, she's the perfect alibi <br>
Please don't search for me my darling, I did not leave any trace of me behind <br>
Please don't search for me, my darling, I am leaving you this simple lullaby <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
I am leaving to Peru <br>
I will walk among the mountains, like any decent mountaineer would do <br>
Please don't follow me my darling, I will be at a much higher altitude <br>
Your lungs will not adjust, so you must not follow me into the doom <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
From the hills of Antioch <br>
There are people all around me, but these people do not know that I am lost <br>
I am building a new life here, but the world's too far away for me to walk <br>
But if it wasn't for the cradle, I don't know that I'd be giving you this rock <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
I have found another girl <br>
She is teaching me to sing on key, she is showing me the world <br>
She is old, but she is kind, she is lumpy but she's mine, she's divine <br>
Please don't take it too hard darling, it's a lie, I just want somehow to be heard <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
The only draft that I will send <br>
I am placing faith in nature, I am sending you this letter by the wind <br>
I have found it difficult to swim across the big wide ocean, just a bit more difficult than finding words to give this motion <br>
So, this will not give it justice, but I love you and I hope you're doing well <br>
And if you do return, come quickly, cause I only have a few things left of yours to sell</p>

and it's hurtling (silent t) silently forward <br>
toward us (or is it towards us?) <br>
or maybe backward <br>
is direction subjective? (does it matter?) <br>
from whose point of view? (does it?) <br>
 <br>
feel it <br>
it's always going to be smaller than you expected (smaller modifies always) <br>
i don't (silent not) blame you <br>
shame you (or is it shameful?) <br>
but what did you expect? <br>
is size subjective? (does it matter?) <br>
who got your fucking hopes up? (do they?) <br>
 <br>
let me know because <br>
i always feel a little unreal after everything <br>
happens and you leave <br>
and barreling towards us but <br>
we can't get out of the way <br>
or don't want to <br>
or don't care <br>

(care modifies everything) <br>

try it <br>

<h2>El Cadejo</h2>

<p>i'm glad my subatomic particles decided to shake near yours <br>
because if they hadn't, they might be <br>
feeling a little more uneasy about all this <br>
 <br>
it may be that we rubbed off on each other and left a few pieces behind, <br>
the stragglers scrambling to get back home, <br>
and maybe that's why i can't get close enough <br>
it's deeper than skin <br>
 <br>
i think, but don't believe, but <br>
i think we were born to be alive at the same time and maybe nothing more <br>
 <br>
i am corrupting you <br>
kind of like how sunsets collapse skies until they're just silver pins of light <br>
tucked into a mirror <br>
and we connect them with something of our own <br>
maybe it's like touching god <br>
 <br>
i can reveal the future; watch <br>
but you have to wait awhile <br>
and then it will all happen <br>
 <br>
it's self-referential <br>
it's genuflection with your knees buckled in, <br>
it's dripping sweat, but it's wine, but instead of wine, it's blood, it's <br>
honeybees scratching behind your teeth <br>
and building hives in your cavernous body, <br>
cavernous <br>
only to them <br>
 <br>
you are more like a deer than a dog, and more dear to me than the things i cannot see <br>
like honeybees scratching inside your heart <br>
 <br>
i'm building a house <br>
or another metaphor for learning <br>
something i'm not quite comfortable with <br>
the physical manifestation of my desire to provide you with <br>
something i can't articulate <br>
but feels a lot like doom <br>
 <br>
but if it gets so bad, we can <br>
sit on my porch, watch Him rip holes in the fabric <br>
and plead <br>
leave it untouched, no one goes there <br>
no one wants to, we just watch <br>
 <br>
to me, it's a meadow, nestled beneath the golden hearth, tucked like a birds feathers, <br>
warm, supple, magnetic, <br>
it's miles long and i can cross with just one stride <br>
and my footsteps leave no prints <br>
 <br>
i believe that i love you <br>
i know the sun will rise, but i believe it will bring warmth <br>
 <br>
i think, but don't believe, but <br>
i think there is a god for nature and a god of humans <br>
and i think one of them is <br>
me and one of them is you </p>

<h2>Cobwebs</h2>

<p>As I clean out the last box from my room, I see a spider crawling through the threshold,<br>
moving in.<br>
He's renting the house from my family as they move across country and I move<br>
across mine.<br>
<br>
My family and I are going our separate ways,<br>
citing creative differences.<br>
I am John Lennon and they are the Beatles;<br>
I am the most successful for now,<br>
but I'll be dead soon and Paul will take my place.<br>
<br>
The new tenant brings his family in,<br>
swarms of a big, black pulsing crawling through cracks in the hardwood, through the windows, up from the sewer, into<br>
the kitchen, the bedroom, the photo albums, the sock drawers,<br>
the time I chased my sister into the banister, the broken dishwasher, all wriggling legs and little eyes, into the last time we eat dinner together, past the threshold, the empty space between my mother's heart and my father's grace.<br>
They weave<br>
a silken thread into the very fabric of life.<br>
<br>
A vision, as I drive down the five with my car packed, away from home, towards home<br>
of my car splintering open from the side, skidding across traffic-<br>
my mangled corpse, bloodied with road rash, scattered amongst the landmarks of a life once lived.<br>
Y'know, papers and such.<br>
<br>
I am the man tasked with building the biggest enclosure in the world,<br>
who constructs a small fence around himself and claims he's on the outside.<br>
I guess it's all a matter of perspective.<br>
<br>
I am exploring myself on the street, rummaging through the debris, looting the body.<br>
I am suffering as the spider eats the beetle with uncanny precision.<br>
I am building a fence and I am standing on the outside,<br>
watching spiders spin webs, catching everything I love,<br>
thinking I'm going to miss everything-<br>
No, I'm going to miss everything<br></p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I'm going to keep those closest to me alive through my writing<br>
That way we’ll never hurt again<br>
I’m going to keep those closest to me alive through my writing about it<br>
And we’ll never<br>
<br>
Die or hear about it<br>
We’ll give it one good old college try<br>
And even if I don’t make it through my fourth semester<br>
One day I will laugh about it all<br>
<br>
Cause I want Emma to live forever even if she can’t<br>
<br>
I’m going to write myself into truth if it’s so esoteric<br>
That only I will understand<br>
I’m going to write myself into youth, if it’s the last thing I do<br>
And I’ll never say goodbye<br>
<br>
Or be lonely again<br>
Even if I’m lonesome now<br>
And I’m going to build my own little world inside of all my music<br>
One day, that’s where I’ll spend all my time<br>
<br>
Cause I want Ana to live forever even if she don't<br>
<br>
One day, I will be impervious to criticism<br>
And I’ll never cry again<br>
One day, I will write the song that grants us all forgiveness<br>
And I’ll throw my guitar in the sea<br>
Just leave it to me<br>
I’ll write us all free<br>
Just listen to me<br>
Yes, please buy my CD<br>
Spend a moment with me<br>
<br>
Because ultimately, I want to live forever and God knows I'll die<br>
God knows I'll die<br>
God knows I'll die trying</p>
	
<h2>Dick Gilbert’s Dream</h2>
<p>I thought I saw you in the night arcade<br>
Wearing only a kimono<br>
You were playing a street fighter game<br>
<br>
And I asked you if you knew my name<br>
You shook your head no<br>
When I turned back, you had changed into a Nekomata<br>

I thought I saw you at the Pergamon<br>
I was searching for salvation<br>
You were waiting at the Ishtar Gate<br>

I told you one day I’d be the white Bob Dylan<br>
And I’ve never been so nervous<br>
Than when you forgot to laugh<br>
<br>
You can find it in Nardis<br>
You can find it in Godot<br>
You can find it in the Redwoods<br>
And you can find it at home<br>
Well, you could find it in the Bible<br>
You can find it in your mother too<br>
After all she is the one who birthed you<br>
<br>
I could have sworn you were the singer at a jazz bar up in London<br>
You had the whole club dancing when you played “New York I Love You”<br>
<br>
Dancing in public for the first time in a long time<br>
I filmed every single second<br>
But the footage was destroyed in post<br>
<br>
And then you were the DJ at a German Disco<br>
You had even Francis dancing when you played “MacArthur Park”<br>
<br>
I spent the weekend trying to find you on the poster<br>
They shut the show down early<br>
But I caught you just outside<br>
<br>
And we rediscovered music<br>
On the banks of the Spree<br>
And by five o’clock your time<br>
We had set each other free<br>
Well you could find it in a country far away from where you supposed to be<br>
Do you think you’ll ever come back and see me?<br>
<br>
I think I said to you, something pretentious like, “I found it all in London<br>
My revolt, freedom, and passion<br>
That were never really mine”<br>
<br>
You could tell I had some deep regrets about traveling alone, but I wouldn’t tell a soul<br>
<br>
And I never saw it coming<br>
No I never learned your name<br>
And I tumbled down the mountain<br>
But I’m happy just the same<br>
Well if you can’t find it inside you<br>
You could hide it in the lesser truth<br>
But what a terrible thing to do<br>
<br>
And you said, “You fucked it all up trying to go so far,<br>
You should come back to Los Angeles<br>
And we’ll fall in love with movie stars<br>
<br>
“And we’ll go dancing and wear fur coats and convert to Judaism, no<br>
We’ll never be alone again and<br>
You will find me in your dreams”<br>
<br>
Of course, reality was not so strange<br>
You watched a silent movie<br>
While I fell asleep on the train<br>
<br>
We walked to my house in the cold wet streets<br>
You lent me Dinner with Andre<br>
	And we talked about it over coffee</p>
	
<h2>A Song for Sierra</h2>
<p>Thomas, I remember when we met <br>
I was studying abroad <br>
I was shopping Fortnum and Mason <br>
When you bumped into me hard <br>
I dropped my camera, cracked the screen <br>
All your friends laughed and called you the Queen of England <br>
I knew we were meant to be then <br>
<br>
You moved to the states two summers later <br>
I remember cause you sent me letter after letter <br>
Chronicling your stay <br>
"My friend, each day is better than the last; <br>
There must be something in the water cause I've never felt as joyous or as anxious to see someone again." <br>
<br>
Thomas, let's go to the movies <br>
I'm praying you won't listen to me <br>
Cause I never say anything at all <br>
<br>
Oh lover, I can't forget that first night <br>
Drunk off our distance, listening to Rhye <br>
And every day after was heaven, how pleasant to be in love <br>
Oh, and as days go by, I sit back and look fondly on our memories <br>
A lifetime spent with you is surely better than living twice <br>
<br>
And I swear it's like destiny: I mean, the two number one biggest fans of Todd Rundgren in one room-- what are the odds of that happening? <br>
Love blooms in the time between the private glances, the timid shake in your step as we dance to Queen <br>
Has it kicked in yet? or is this mercury poisoning? <br>
My God, you're killing me! <br>
<br>
Thomas, won't you marry me?<br>
Take me away from everything <br>
It feels like we've been dying on our own <br>
<br>
Oh lover, it's been years since we met <br>
But how is it I'm still learning your secrets <br>
You've never seen Forrest Gump, but you quote it every Valentine's Day <br>
And I'm glad we stuck it out <br>
When times were tough I had my doubts <br>
But when you smile I swear the clock stops and the ocean takes a breath <br>
Oh, endlessly receding, but it never really ends <br>
<br>
Thomas, you're gonna bury me <br>
There's something about your voice when we're arguing <br>
Reminds me of my father in the kitchen with my mother <br>
And they did not know that I was watching <br>
But I saw him teach her not to bother him no more <br>
Thomas, I'm sorry, I'm sure you'd never get that way <br>
If you have something to say don't let me get in the way <br>
And I'm sure things will turn out okay <br>
	Yes, I'm sure things will turn out just peachy</p>
		
<h2>A New York Lullaby</h2>
<p>Lonely road I been traveling<br>
I can see for miles from where I stand<br>
But when it gets down to the business of it all<br>
I go back to where I been<br>
<br>
It’s a hopeless road I been traveling<br>
Many men have told me so<br>
Though I do have many years to go<br>
I feel indifference setting in<br>
<br>
I’m not searching for religion<br>
I’m just tryna find some truth<br>
And I’m not burning up with questions<br>
I’m just burning up my youth<br>
So, please don’t try to persuade me<br>
There’s nothing you know that I don’t<br>
If you are aching for some meaning<br>
It’s time to let the boulder go<br>
<br>
Cold wind blows in from the ocean<br>
But you don’t have those where you live<br>
Something left footsteps in the sand, they trace a winding path back home<br>
Where we used to be kids<br>
<br>
I’ll abandon my convictions<br>
I will leave the past for dead<br>
I will bare my soul completely<br>
I won’t ever leave my bed<br>
So, please don’t try to persuade me<br>
There’s nothing you know that I don’t<br>
You don’t have to forgive me unless you know what I’ve done<br>
<br>
I’m not searching for redemption <br>
I’m just trying to find a home<br>
There’s an answer in the question<br>
There’s nothing I know that you won’t<br>
But this song is not about me<br>
I only sing it cause you won’t<br>
<br>
Julia, Julia<br>
Please don’t listen to your father<br>
Don’t listen to your son<br>
You have everything you need<br>
If you can find it, at the bottom of your lungs<br>
I will not try to persuade you<br>
But I will answer you just once<br>
Yes, someday you’ll be alone<br>
And mom and dad have passed below<br>
And you’ll have no place else to go<br>
If you need me, I’ll be here always<br>
	But I promise you can make it on your own</p>
	
<h2>A Song from Sierra, originally written by Sierra Skye</h2>
<p>Oliver, I just want all of your love<br>
To be a big fish in a small pond<br>
I’ll test your mettle, babe, or test your luck<br>
Give you the rest of my heart<br>
<br>
Loving you is never easy, but it’s not hard<br>
Oliver, all I want is your love<br>
<br>
Looking out on the morning rain, I used to feel uninspired<br>
Till your eyes caught mine in the month of May<br>
It came so easy<br>
You came so easy to me<br>
Ease into me<br>
<br>
Oliver, I want you to see me as I am<br>
Oliver, I am broken in your warm hands<br>
Bump into my back and we will fall into the mattress and get drunk in two seconds flat<br>
What’s the matter with that?<br>
<br>
Oliver, I want all your thoughts<br>
Deliver me from what I most want<br>
A life like caramel and apples and cinnamon and rum<br>
You make my heart go mmmm<br>
<br>
Oliver, I just want all of your time<br>
To be the cadence in your simplest rhyme<br>
I’ll never settle unless I find you inside my heart<br>
All of her inside my heart<br>
<br>
	Olie, I’m a prize and you’re a catch and we’re a perfect match; you make my heart go !!!</p>

<h2>A Lovely Illusion</h2>
<p>Momma, I think I've found the one<br>
No, you don't understand momma, she's as free as the sun <br>
And as delicate too, just as blue and exactly as warm and exactly as true <br>
Momma, I feel about her the same way dad felt about you <br>
<br>
Can I tell you about her? <br>
She's changing my mind <br>
I've found after so much time spent together I've become kind <br>
And she only grows kinder, she's my daily reminder God's love is alive and inspired <br>
And I find that my life's a garden of gracious desire <br>
<br>
Shuffle my fingers; I'm nervous as always <br>
She's happiness, smiles and dancing-- she makes me feel old <br>
You know, it hurts me to know of the two of us I am the one with no soul <br>
As perfect as she is, I'm barely a line in a poem <br>
<br>
She takes a deep breath and never lets go <br>
The sky swells with rain and her lips move but her words come slow <br>
And the rain turns to snow; I'm gasping for air and she's asking to go <br>
She says, "This is the only way I know to help you grow." <br>
<br>
Open my window, let the sun in, and pick up a book <br>
I can't move my hands the right way, I can't make myself look <br>
So, I run my fingers like raised dots would press themselves in and my whole world would change <br>
	My room fills with music and I learn to turn a new page</p>
	
	<h2>A Old Man</h2>
<p>My old man’s a painter<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He’s got a sexton’s patience and he’s got a one room flat<br>
He wears a rainter’s paincoat; he holds the Treasury keys<br>
And every Saturday evening, he paints a masterpiece<br>
And someday, if I can, I’m gonna be an artist the same as my old man<br>
<br>
My old man’s a Maytag repairman<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He’s never lost his temper, he’s never called me Matt<br>
He owes the Lord a favor, he tends the family tree<br>
And every Saturday evening, he digs for Sunday’s key<br>
And someday, if I can, I’m gonna own a coin wash the same as my old man<br>
<br>
My old man’s a folk song<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He never changes tempo, he’s never sharp or flat<br>
He has a simple melody that never changes key<br>
And on one Sunday evening, he taught the song to me<br>
And someday, if I can, I’m gonna write a song so sweet that it brings Jerusalem<br>
<br>
My old man’s a fountain<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He swallows up the ocean, but he always brings it back<br>
He casts a frightening shadow, he’s shallow as a dream<br>
And on one Sunday morning, he taught the sun to breathe<br>
And someday, if I can, I’m gonna be a mother the same as my old man<br>
<br>
My old man’s a fighter<br>
What do you think about that?<br>
He bores into the Bible, and falls unto the mat<br>
He is leaving, I am leaving, but they never got Ali<br>
And on one Saturday evening, he gave Sunday to me<br>
And someday, if I can I’m going to fight the King of Judah and lose like my old man<br>
<br>
My old man’s a prophet<br>
And I don’t care what you think<br>
He celebrates the meager, he turns the other cheek<br>
He’s built a love worth giving, he gives it unto thee<br>
And on one Friday evening, he sold us into grief<br>
And someday, count to three<br>
I’m going to the garden same as my old king<br>
	Where the beauteous tree of golden olives blooms in fairest green</p>
	
	<h2>A Requiem for Ethan, the first song I ever wrote</h2>
<p>They sunk the submarine on April 15th<br>
They promised us they’d never lost a war<br>
They all swore they’d never forget the war<br>
But now they’re veterans and we’re all ears<br>
<br>
Sing a hymnal about redemption and throw your body off a cliff<br>
Because you’re a martyr now and your soul is more important than your body is<br>
Hold a wicked candle above your heart to blur the line between the black and white<br>
<br>
You’re sick of all the therapy, why are you upset?<br>
Alcohol and cigarettes: we have cures for depression<br>
And I thought you lost your fear of staying here, when you left here<br>
But instead you lost your fear of dying<br>
<br>
Well, I’m sorry to tell you<br>
There’s no time for grieving, the President’s been shot dead<br>
It’s his head; they said it couldn’t handle the stress of his moral dilemma<br>
He slept on the couch and it’s never been better<br>
You’re slowly forgetting the letter you wrote back home<br>
They were too slow<br>
<br>
There’s a safety belt for a reason<br>
You sneak out the window to go climbing in trees<br>
And the birds and the bees and the words you’ve lost meaning for<br>
And everyone’s so sore and I’m so sure<br>
Life is a closing door<br>
<br>
So, take a lesson from the tree that never grew<br>
There is nothing you can achieve that you want to<br>
So, I’ll forget about it and watch TV till I fall asleep<br>
Oh, let’s move to Boston and talk to no one<br>
Is there anything else cause I’m tired of thinking?<br>
<br>
They’ve perfected the distraction, I don’t wanna go outside anymore<br>
Life’s so boring<br>
They ever cared about us anyway<br>
Honor the dead and bury the living while they’re still breathing<br>
Oh, they’re nobodies (there are no bodies)<br>
And they can hear the bombs are falling, while the bombs are falling, and the bombs are falling<br>
But your family is calling to see how you’re doing<br>
	Life in the pursuit of peacetime</p>

<h2>A Prayer</h2>
<p>I am Paul McCartney’s ghost<br>
I won’t stop till I eat his heart<br>
It will be warm and beautiful<br>
Like all my memories of you<br>
<br>
All the great cities in our day are full of people who do not like it there<br>
But where we are— where we were, on the shores of consolation, life is lovely<br>
<br>
I can’t help but feel like,<br>
As Ingrid Bergman said,<br>
I am dying in my life, but living in my art<br>
You’re one of two people I know who might know what she means<br>
<br>
We only have a few days left, so I’d like to say<br>
There’s an easier way out, but I think we both know the right way to go</p>
		
<h2>A Promise</h2>
<p>Wish I remembered what brought us together<br>
After school, alienation, some kind of  commiserative transgression<br>
Or an obsession with some obscure TV show<br>
Proximity, affinity, sublime connection, et cetera, cetera<br>
<br>
Hey! There ain't never gonna be friends like this again!<br>
I got the best of 'em, the rest of you suckers can go home<br>
Hey! <br>
Ain't nothing gon' come between me and my friends<br>
<br>
Semper fi or something, do or die, voluntary alibi<br>
Like I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine, <br>
Hit me up sometime<br>
Yah that's (760) 859-6140, I'm not exclusive, I got love for everyone, anyone<br>
<br>
Hey! There ain't never gonna be friends like this again!<br>
I got the best of 'em, the rest of you suckers can go home<br>
Hey! <br>
Ain't nothing gon' come between me and my friends<br>

Don’t listen to a word you hear<br>
If I am in your ear, know that you’re listening to me now<br>
Not the other way around<br>
Don’t listen to a word I say<br>
I felt the same way you did someday<br>
I am just a phone call away<br>
<br>
Hey! There ain't never gonna be friends like this again!<br>
I got the best of 'em, the rest of you suckers can go home<br>
Hey! <br>
Ain't nothing gon' come between me and my friends<br>
<br>
Kyle, I am listening to you now<br>
So tell me all about the fear we’ve only talked around<br>
And maybe we can drown them out<br>
	Or show each other how</p>
	
	<h2>A Letter to Carry</h2>
<p>Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
I am telling you goodbye <br>
I am moving to New England, with my mother, she's the perfect alibi <br>
Please don't search for me my darling, I did not leave any trace of me behind <br>
Please don't search for me, my darling, I am leaving you this simple lullaby <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
I am leaving to Peru <br>
I will walk among the mountains, like any decent mountaineer would do <br>
Please don't follow me my darling, I will be at a much higher altitude <br>
Your lungs will not adjust, so you must not follow me into the doom <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
From the hills of Antioch <br>
There are people all around me, but these people do not know that I am lost <br>
I am building a new life here, but the world's too far away for me to walk <br>
But if it wasn't for the cradle, I don't know that I'd be giving you this rock <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
I have found another girl <br>
She is teaching me to sing on key, she is showing me the world <br>
She is old, but she is kind, she is lumpy but she's mine, she's divine <br>
Please don't take it too hard darling, it's a lie, I just want somehow to be heard <br>
 <br>
Keri I am writing you this letter <br>
The only draft that I will send <br>
I am placing faith in nature, I am sending you this letter by the wind <br>
I have found it difficult to swim across the big wide ocean, just a bit more difficult than finding words to give this motion <br>
So, this will not give it justice, but I love you and I hope you're doing well <br>
And if you do return, come quickly, cause I only have a few things left of yours to sell</p>
	
<h2>A Gift from God</h2>
<p>Someone saved my life today<br>
Across the street, a woman called out my name<br>
And I don’t know hers, but I think I’ll name her Matthew<br>
Her voice split the night two ways<br>
She said, “Cross the street now boy, don’t go down that way,”<br>
And sure enough in the shadow of a street lamp, there was a wild dog looking at me<br>
With those yellow eyes that they give to all the false believers<br>
<br>
Had a dream it was yesterday<br>
An angel of the lord went to you and said<br>
It’s my time to take your time away<br>
Woke up and left the past for dead<br>
And an angel of your own came to me instead<br>
and told me, leave your dying landlord, she’s got nowhere to be<br>
I’ll take you to the city of our queen<br>
Where the streets are gold and the oil flows like Dick Cheney’s wettest dream<br>
<br>
I was born on the mourning day<br>
With golden yellow skin and blue eyes of gray<br>
They said, we’re cursed, but he won’t be, let’s name him Matthew<br>
Now, I know that God knows my name<br>
And I walk hand in hand with fate and I feel no pain<br>
Cause I shook hands with the devil and he smiled at me<br>
He said one day you’re going to be a king<br>
And you’ll write a million songs as retribution for the million lives you stole<br>
Yes, you’ll never be the king of anything unless you write yourself a soul<br>
<br>
Someone changed my life today<br>
I got a letter telling me it would be okay<br>
Because it’s more than what you seek<br>
She said it’s yours to take<br>
Woke up to a dream today<br>
She was standing right in front of my with another face<br>
I told her, you should know, I haven’t slept in weeks<br>
And she said, you’ll never write another Love Supreme<br>
And I told her, I’ll never write another song until I’m facedown in a grave<br>
Cause I only need to write one song and I think I wrote that song today <br>
<br>
And so if no one saves my life someday<br>
I need to learn now how to be okay<br>
There’s no good way to say it- I misplaced all my faith<br>
I must’ve sat down and prayed today<br>
Woody’s voice, must’ve been, came to me to say<br>
There’s no cathartic moment, you just have to ask for grace and now I know<br>
We’re walking with numbered days and<br>
How precious each step became<br>
Stuck a knife into his forehead, now he’s blinder than me<br>
And I said, Bob you won’t believe what I can see<br>
And I don’t know what I’m gonna do, but I know just who I’m gonna be</p>
